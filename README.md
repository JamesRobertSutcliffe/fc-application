 What I particularly enjoyed about coding journey so far:

I love being at forefront of tech
would love to study more AI - help address issues with AI / AI impact on creativity
I struggle with social anxiety - Love the community of coding / F + C - Sharing common interest in coding / felt welcomed
- 3 - Medium blog linked to site via API

- What I struggled with:

Imposter syndrome
lack of direction / overwhelmed
Not learning quick enough
Worried I wasn't capable / whether it was right for me (Although I am sure now!)

Where I am now:

Confident with HTML, CSS / JS
Learning modern tech and full stack
trying to utilise AI (chat GPT)
